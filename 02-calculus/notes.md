### ðŸ”¹ Week 3â€“4: Derivatives and Gradients

**Why:**  
Derivatives = how your model knows which way to improve.

**Learn:**
- What a derivative is (rate of change)
- What a gradient is (derivative in multiple dimensions)
- Why it's key in gradient descent

**âœ… Resources:**
- ðŸŽ¥ *Khan Academy*: Intro to Derivatives
- ðŸ“„ Code gradient descent for a simple function
