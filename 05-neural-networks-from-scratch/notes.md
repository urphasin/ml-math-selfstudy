## ðŸ“• Level 5: Neural Networks From Scratch â€“ Build Your First Model by Hand

### ðŸ”¹ Week 9â€“10: Understand and Code a Simple Neural Network from Zero

**Why?**  
This level ties all the math and programming you learned into a working model. Instead of relying on libraries, youâ€™ll implement a basic neural network yourself, so you deeply understand how each part works â€” from input to output, including training with backpropagation.

**Goals:**
- Understand the architecture of a neural network (layers, nodes, weights, biases)
- Implement forward propagation â€” how data flows through the network to produce output
- Implement loss functions to measure how wrong the networkâ€™s predictions are
- Implement backpropagation â€” the math that adjusts weights using gradients
- Train a simple network on a tiny dataset (e.g., classify AND/OR logic gates or MNIST digits)
- Experiment with activation functions (sigmoid, ReLU, softmax)
